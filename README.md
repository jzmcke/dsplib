# dsplib
# This is a fun repository for exploring DSP related problems.
# Current contents:
#
# 1. Huffman encoder/decoder
# STATUS: Working
# TODO:
#  - Add huffman table to bitstream
#  - Add real-time capabilities (push/pull interface)
#
# 2. Bitstream maths
# STATUS: Complete
#
# 3. Random binary generator
# STATUS: Complete
#
# 4. DFT/IDFT/FFT/IFFT
# STATUS: Sufficient for use on small (<64000) sample sizes. Definitely
# 	  sufficient for real-time processing.
